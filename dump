VThe Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on NASA's New Horizon Pluto mission has collected solar wind observations en route from Earth to Pluto, and these observations continue beyond Pluto. Few missions have explored the solar wind in the outer heliosphere making this dataset a critical addition to the field. We created a forward model of SWAP count rates, which includes a comprehensive instrument response function based on laboratory and flight calibrations. By fitting the count rates with this model, the proton density (n), speed (V), and temperature (T) parameters are determined. Comparisons between SWAP parameters and both propagated 1 AU observations and prior Voyager 2 observations indicate consistency in both the range and mean wind values. These comparisons as well as our additional findings confirm that small and midsized solar wind structures are worn down with increasing distance due to dynamic interaction of parcels of wind with different speed. For instance, the T-V relationship steepens, as the range in V is limited more than the range in T with distance. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU, which may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T reflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere. The power of wind parameters at shorter periodicities decreases with distance as the longer periodicities strengthen. The solar rotation periodicity is present in temperature beyond 20 AU indicating the observed parcel temperature may reflect not only current heating or cooling, but also heating occurring closer to the Sun.

VThe abundance and spatial distribution of ultra-diffuse galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters
p351
sVabstract
p352
VRecent observations have highlighted a significant population of faint but large (r_eff>1.5 kpc) galaxies in the Coma cluster. The origin of these Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) remains puzzling, as the interpretation of these observational results has been hindered by the subjective selection of UDGs, and the limited study of only the Coma (and some examples in the Virgo-) cluster. In this paper we extend the study of UDGs using eight clusters in the redshift range 0.044<z<0.063 with deep g- and r-band imaging data taken with MegaCam at the CFHT. We describe an automatic selection pipeline for a quantitative identification, tested for completeness using image simulations of these galaxies. We find that the abundance of the UDGs we can detect increases with cluster mass, reaching ~200 in typical haloes of M200~10^15 Msun. The cluster UDGs have colours consistent with the cluster red sequence, and have a steep size distribution that declines as n ~ r_eff^-3.4. Their radial distribution is significantly steeper than NFW in the outskirts, and significantly shallower in the inner parts. They follow the same radial distribution as the more massive quiescent galaxies in the clusters, except within the core region of r < 0.15 X R200 (or <300 kpc). Within this region the number density of UDGs drops and is consistent with zero. These diffuse galaxies can only resist tidal forces down to this cluster-centric distance if they are completely dark matter dominated. Moreover, this picture is consistent with the observation that the radial distribution of more compact dwarf galaxies (r_eff<1.0 kpc) with similar luminosities follows the same distribution as the UDGs, but they exist down to a smaller distance of 100 kpc from the cluster centres. Although a number of scenarios can give rise to the UDG population, our results point to differences in the formation history as the most plausible explanation.

VThe Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on NASA's New Horizon Pluto mission has collected solar wind observations en route from Earth to Pluto, and these observations continue beyond Pluto. Few missions have explored the solar wind in the outer heliosphere making this dataset a critical addition to the field. We created a forward model of SWAP count rates, which includes a comprehensive instrument response function based on laboratory and flight calibrations. By fitting the count rates with this model, the proton density (n), speed (V), and temperature (T) parameters are determined. Comparisons between SWAP parameters and both propagated 1 AU observations and prior Voyager 2 observations indicate consistency in both the range and mean wind values. These comparisons as well as our additional findings confirm that small and midsized solar wind structures are worn down with increasing distance due to dynamic interaction of parcels of wind with different speed. For instance, the T-V relationship steepens, as the range in V is limited more than the range in T with distance. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU, which may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T reflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere.

VThe Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on NASA's New Horizon Pluto mission has collected solar wind observations en route from Earth to Pluto, and these observations continue beyond Pluto. Few missions have explored the solar wind in the outer heliosphere making this dataset a critical addition to the field. We created a forward model of SWAP count rates, which includes a comprehensive instrument response function based on laboratory and flight calibrations. By fitting the count rates with this model, the proton density (n), speed (V), and temperature (T) parameters are determined. Comparisons between SWAP parameters and both propagated 1 AU observations and prior Voyager 2 observations indicate consistency in both the range and mean wind values. These comparisons as well as our additional findings confirm that small and midsized solar wind structures are worn down with increasing distance due to dynamic interaction of parcels of wind with different speed. For instance, the T-V relationship steepens, as the range in V is limited more than the range in T with distance. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU, which may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T reflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere. The power of wind parameters at shorter periodicities decreases with distance as the longer periodicities strengthen. The solar rotation periodicity is present in temperature beyond 20 AU indicating the observed parcel temperature may reflect not only current heating or cooling, but also heating occurring closer to the Sun.

VIntroducing map-reduce to high end computing
p909
sVabstract
p910
VIn this work we present an scientific application that has been given a Hadoop MapReduce implementation. We also discuss other scientific fields of supercomputing that could benefit from a MapReduce implementation. We recognize in this work that Hadoop has potential benefit for more applications than simply data mining, but that it is not a panacea for all data intensive applications. We provide an example of how the halo finding application, when applied to large astrophysics datasets, benefits from the model of the Hadoop architecture. The halo finding application uses a friends of friends algorithm to quickly cluster together large sets of particles to output files which a visualization software can interpret. The current implementation requires that large datasets be moved from storage to computation resources for every simulation of astronomy data. Our Hadoop implementation allows for an in-place halo finding application on the datasets, which removes the time consuming process of transferring data between resources.

VMap-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore
p991
sVabstract
p992
VWe are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly ap- plicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15] can be written in a certain \u201csummation form,\u201d which allows them to be easily par- allelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google\u2019s map-reduce [7] paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regres- sion (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.

VGenerate-map-reduce: An extension to map-reduce to support shared data and recursive computations
p1059
sVabstract
p1060
VIt is difficult to express the parallelism present in complex computations by using existing higher level abstractions such as MapReduce and Dryad. These computations include applications from wide variety of domains, like Artificial Intelligence, Decision Tree Algorithms, Association Rule Mining, Recommender Systems, Graph Algorithms, Clustering Algorithms, Compute Intensive Scientific Workflows, Optimization Algorithms, and so forth. Their execution graphs introduce new challenges in terms of programmer expressibility and runtime performance such as iterative and recursive computations, shared communication model, and so forth. We propose an extension to MapReduce, called Generate-Map-Reduce (GMR), targeted towards modeling these applications. GMR introduces a new Generate abstraction into the MapReduce framework that captures recursive computations. The runtime also supports iterative jobs and a distributed communication model by using shared data structures. We illustrate recursive computations with GMR by modeling complex applications such as simulated annealing, A* search, and adaptive quadrature computation that require recursive spawning of new tasks to handle variable degree of parallelism. GMR runtime supports caching of common data across iterations in memory and local disks. We illustrate how this caching helps in achieving significant speedup for iterative computations by modeling k-means clustering. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VOn scheduling in map-reduce and flow-shops
p1112
sVabstract
p1113
VThe map-reduce paradigm is now standard in industry and academia for processing large-scale data. In this work, we formalize job scheduling in map-reduce as a novel generalization of the two-stage classical flexible flow shop (FFS) problem: instead of a single task at each stage, a job now consists of a set of tasks per stage. For this generalization, we consider the problem of minimizing the total flowtime and give an efficient 12-approximation in the offline setting and an online (1+µ)-speed O(1/µ2)-competitive algorithm. Motivated by map-reduce, we revisit the two-stage flow shop problem, where we give a dynamic program for minimizing the total flowtime when all jobs arrive at the same time. If there are fixed number of job-types the dynamic program yields a PTAS; it is also a QPTAS when the processing times of jobs are polynomially bounded. This gives the first improvement in approximation of flowtime for the two-stage flow shop problem since the trivial 2-approximation algorithm of Gonzalez and Sahni [29] in 1978, and the first known approximation for the FFS problem. We then consider the generalization of the two-stage FFS problem to the unrelated machines case, where we give an offline 6-approximation and an online (1+µ)-speed O(1/µ4)-competitive algorithm.

VMap, reduce and mapreduce, the skeleton way
p1170
sVabstract
p1171
VComposition of Map and Reduce algorithmic skeletons have been widely studied at the end of the last century and it has demonstrated effective on a wide class of problems. We recall the theoretical results motivating the introduction of these skeletons, then we discuss an experiment implementing three algorithmic skeletons, a map, a reduce and an optimized composition of a map followed by a reduce skeleton (map+reduce). The map+reduce skeleton implemented computes the same kind of problems computed by Google MapReduce, but the data flow through the skeleton is streamed rather than relying on already distributed (and possibly quite large) data items. We discuss the implementation of the three skeletons on top of ProActive/GCM in the MareMare prototype and we present some experimental obtained on a COTS cluster.

VScalable Process Discovery using Map-Reduce
p1221
sVabstract
p1222
VProcess discovery is an approach to extract process models from event logs. Given the distributed nature of modern information systems, event logs are likely to be distributed across different physical machines. Map-Reduce is a scalable approach for efficient computations on distributed data. In this paper we present Map-Reduce implementations of two wellknown process mining algorithms to take advantage of the scalability of the Map-Reduce approach. We present the design of a series of mappers and reducers to compute the log-based ordering relations from distributed event logs. These can then be used to discover a process model. We provide experimental results that show the performance and scalability of our implementations.

VImplementing Parallel Google Map-Reduce in Eden
p1255
sVabstract
p1256
VRecent publications have emphasised map-reduce as a general programming model (labelled Google map-reduce), and described existing high-performance implementations for large data sets. We present two parallel implementations for this Google map-reduce skeleton, one following earlier work, and one optimised version, in the parallel Haskell extension Eden. Edenâ€™s specific features, like lazy stream processing, dynamic reply channels, and nondeterministic stream merging, support the efficient implementation of the complex coordination structure of this skeleton. We compare the two implementations of the Google map-reduce skeleton in usage and performance, and deliver runtime analyses for example applications. Although very flexible, the Google map-reduce skeleton is often too general, and typical examples reveal a better runtime behaviour using alternative skeletons.

VMap-reduce-merge
p1301
sVabstract
p1302
VMap-Reduce is a programming model that enables easy development of scalable parallel applications to process a vast amount of data on large clusters of commodity machines. Through a simple interface with two functions, map and reduce, this model facilitates parallel implementation of many real-world tasks such as data processing jobs for search engines and machine learning. However,this model does not directly support processing multiple related heterogeneous datasets. While processing relational data is a common need, this limitation causes difficulties and/or inefficiency when Map-Reduce is applied on relational operations like joins. We improve Map-Reduce into a new model called Map-Reduce-Merge. It adds to Map-Reduce a Merge phase that can efficiently merge data already partitioned and sorted (or hashed) by map and reduce modules. We also demonstrate that this new model can express relational algebra operators as well as implement several join algorithms.

VEfficient map/reduce-based DBSCAN algorithm with optimized data partition
p1361
sVabstract
p1362
VDBSCAN is a well-known algorithm for density-based clustering because it can identify the groups of arbitrary shapes and deal with noisy datasets. However, with the increasing amount of data, DBSCAN algorithm running on a single machine has to face the scalability problem. In this paper, we propose a Map/Reduce-based DBSCAN algorithm called DBSCAN-MR to solve the scalability problem. In DBSCAN-MR, the input dataset is partitioned into smaller parts and then parallel processed on the Hadoop platform. However, choosing different partition mechanisms will affect the execution efficiency and load balance of each node. Therefore, we propose a method, partition with reduce boundary points (PRBP), to select partition boundaries based on the distribution of data points. Our experimental results show that DBSCAN-MR with the design of PRBP has higher efficiency and scalability than competitors.

VModeling I/O Interference in Data Intensive Map-Reduce Applications
p1411
sVabstract
p1412
VMap-Reduce is a popular framework for very large-scale data mining and processing. Recently, some works have attempted to model the behavior of Map-Reduce, but these existing models ignore the non-linearity of disk I/O performance under contention, which is a critical aspect of estimating the performance of data intensive applications. Understanding I/O interference between tasks running on the same node is critical in optimizing task scheduling for improved resource utilization. In this paper, we present a model to estimate the I/O behavior of Map-Reduce applications that can be used to achieve these goals. View full abstract

VEnumerating subgraph instances using map-reduce
p1445
sVabstract
p1446
VThe theme of this paper is how to find all instances of a given \u201csam- ple\u201d graph in a larger \u201cdata graph,\u201d using a single round of map- reduce. For the simplest sample graph, the triangle, we improve upon the best known such algorithm. We then examine the gen- eral case, considering both the communication cost between map- pers and reducers and the total computation cost at the reducers. To minimize communication cost, we exploit the techniques of [2] for computing multiway joins (evaluating conjunctive queries) in a single map-reduce round. Several methods are shown for trans- lating sample graphs into a union of conjunctive queries with as few queries as possible. We also address the matter of optimizing computation cost. Many serial algorithms are shown to be \u201ccon- vertible,\u201d in the sense that it is possible to partition the data graph, explore each partition in a separate reducer, and have the total work at the reducers be of the same order as the work of the serial algo- rithm. For data graphs of unrestricted degree, we show that there are convertible algorithms whose running time is of the same or- der as the lower bounds on number of occurrences of the sample graph that were provided by [4]. We also offer better convertible algorithms when the degree of nodes in a data graph of m nodes is limited to \u221a m.

VClassification Algorithms for Big Data Analysis, a Map Reduce Approach
p1496
sVabstract
p1497
VSince many years ago, the scientific community is concerned about how to increase the accuracy of different classification methods, and major achievements have been made so far. Besides this issue, the increasing amount of data that is being generated every day by remote sensors raises more challenges to be overcome. In this work, a tool within the scope of InterIMAGE Cloud Platform (ICP), which is an open-source, distributed framework for automatic image interpretation, is presented. The tool, named ICP: Data Mining Package, is able to perform supervised classification procedures on huge amounts of data, usually referred as big data, on a distributed infrastructure using Hadoop MapReduce. The tool has four classification algorithms implemented, taken from WEKA's machine learning library, namely: Decision Trees, Na\u0102\u017bve Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of an experimental analysis using a SVM classifier on data sets of different sizes for different cluster configurations demonstrates the potential of the tool, as well as aspects that affect its performance.

VMapReduce map & reduce function for large datasets
p1626
sVabstract
p1627
VMapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.

VParallel simultaneous co-clustering and learning with map-reduce
p1669
sVabstract
p1670
VMany data mining applications involve predictive modeling of very large, complex datasets. Such applications present a need for innovative algorithms and associated implementations that are not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy, but can also be efficiently run on distributed computational systems to yield results in reasonable time. This paper focuses on predictive modeling of multirelational data such as dyadic data with associated covariates or &amp;#x201C;side-information&amp;#x201D;. We first give illustrative examples of applications that involve such data and then describe a general framework based on Simultaneous CO-clustering And Learning (SCOAL), which applies a divide-and-conquer approach to data analysis. We show that the main elements of the SCOAL algorithm can be effectively parallelized using the Map-Reduce framework. Experiments on Amazon's EC2 demonstrate that the proposed parallelizations result in considerable improvements in run time when using a cluster of machines.

VMRBench: A benchmark for Map-Reduce framework
p1753
sVabstract
p1754
VMapReduce is Google's programming model for easy development of scalable parallel applications which process huge quantity of data on many clusters. Due to its conveniency and efficiency, MapReduce is used in various applications (e.g., Web search services and online analytical processing). However, there are only few good benchmarks to evaluate MapReduce implementations by realistic testsets. In this paper, we present MRBench that is a benchmark for evaluating MapReduce systems. MRBench focuses on processing business oriented queries and concurrent data modifications. To this end, we build MRBench to deal with large volumes of relational data and execute highly complex queries. By MRBench, users can evaluate the performance of MapReduce systems while varying environmental parameters such as data size and the number of (map/reduce) tasks. Our extensive experimental results show that MRBench is a useful tool to benchmark the capability of answering critical business questions.

VUpper and Lower Bounds on the Cost of a Map-reduce Computation
p1814
sVabstract
p1815
VIn this paper we study the tradeoff between parallelism and communication cost in a map-reduce computation. For any problem that is not "embarrassingly parallel," the finer we partition the work of the reducers so that more parallelism can be extracted, the greater will be the total communication between mappers and reducers. We introduce a model of problems that can be solved in a single round of map-reduce computation. This model enables a generic recipe for discovering lower bounds on communication cost as a function of the maximum number of inputs that can be assigned to one reducer. We use the model to analyze the tradeoff for three problems: finding pairs of strings at Hamming distance d, finding triangles and other patterns in a larger graph, and matrix multiplication. For finding strings of Hamming distance 1, we have upper and lower bounds that match exactly. For triangles and many other graphs, we have upper and lower bounds that are the same to within a constant factor. For the problem of matrix multiplication, we have matching upper and lower bounds for one-round map-reduce algorithms. We are also able to explore two-round map-reduce algorithms for matrix multiplication and show that these never have more communication, for a given reducer size, than the best one-round algorithm, and often have significantly less.

VWe present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> \u3008= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> \u3008= 11.75 mag and |b| \u3009= 5° (\u3009=8° toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6% complete to well-defined limits and covers 91% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h <SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> \u3008= 11.25 mag and |b| \u3009= 10°.

VWe present a sample of resolved galactic HII regions and photodissociation regions (PDRs) observed with the Spitzer infrared spectrograph (IRS) in spectral mapping mode between the wavelengths of 5--15 $\u005cmu$m. For each object we have spectral maps at a spatial resolution of $\u005csim$4" in which we have measured all of the mid-infrared emission and absorption features. These include the PAH emission bands, primarily at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2 and 12.7 $\u005cmu$m, as well as the spectral emission lines of neon and sulfur and the absorption band caused by silicate dust at around 9.8 $\u005cmu$m. In this work we describe the data in detail, including the data reduction and measurement strategies, and subsequently present the PAH emission band intensity correlations for each of the objects and the sample as a whole. We find that there are distinct differences between the sources in the sample, with two main groups, the first comprising the HII regions and the second the reflection nebulae (RNe). Three sources, the reflection nebula NGC~7023, the Horsehead nebula PDR (an interface between the HII region IC~434 and the Orion B molecular cloud) and M 17, resist this categorization, with the Horsehead PDR points mimicking the RNe and the NGC~7023 fluxes displaying unique bifurcated appearance in our correlation plots. These discrepancies seem to be due to the very low radiation field experienced by the Horsehead PDR and the very clean separation between the PDR environment and a diffuse environment in the NGC~7023 observations.

VWe examine the evolution of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which has been shown to reproduce the observed redshift z=0.1 colour-magnitude distribution well. The median u-r of star-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z=2 to 0 at fixed stellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red sequence starts to build-up around z=1, due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z=1, which is mostly filled in by z=0. We quantify the time-scales of colour transition due to satellite and AGN quenching, finding that most galaxies spend less than 2 Gyr in the 'green valley'. On examining the trajectories of galaxies in a colour-stellar mass diagram, we identify three characteristic tracks that galaxies follow (quiescently star-forming, quenching and rejuvenating galaxies) and quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track.

VDuring the 100 years that astrophysics has been recognized as a separate discipline, there has been progress in interpreting observations of stars and galaxies using the principles of modern physics. Here we review some of the highlights, including the evolution of stars driven by nuclear reactions in their interiors, the emission of detectable neutrinos by the sun and by a supernova, the rapid and extremely regular rotation of neutron stars, and the accretion of matter onto black holes. A comparison of the observed Universe with the predictions of general relativity is also given.

VThe Dictionary of Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Astronomy provides a lexicon of terminology covering fields such as astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, relativity, geophysics, meteorology, Newtonian physics, and oceanography. Authors and editors often assume - incorrectly - that readers are familiar with all the terms in professional literature. With over 4,000 definitions and 50 contributing authors, this unique comprehensive dictionary helps scientists to use terminology correctly and to understand papers, articles, and books in which physics-related terms appear.

p2193

VThis clear, straightforward, fundamental introduction to radiative processes in astrophysics is designed to present - from a physicist's viewpoint - radiation processes and their applications to astrophysical phenomena and space science. The book covers such topics as radiative transfer theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics, bremsstrahlung radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. The discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulas. Much of the prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference tool. Also included are about 75 problems with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results

VGalaxy Zoo: Exploring the Motivations of Citizen Science Volunteers
p2262
sVabstract
p2263
VThe Galaxy Zoo citizen science website invites anyone with an Internet connection to participate in research by classifying galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 volunteers have made more than 100 million galaxy classifications. In this article, we present results of a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo volunteers and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses that can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations. Our categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining the prevalence of each motivation.

VTACTIC: A new detector for Nuclear Astrophysics Experiments
p2325
sVabstract
p2326
VDirectly measuring nuclear astrophysics reactions presents unique challenges. Low energy reaction products and small reaction cross sections are just two of the issues that the TACTIC detector addresses. TACTIC is the "TRIUMF Annular Chamber for Tracking and Identification of Charged-particles" detector being developed by TRIUMF and the University of York, UK. TACTIC is a cylindrical, active-target TPC providing high detection efficiency; a "shielding" cathode traps the ionization created by the beam and allows for higher intensities than typical TPCs. The 480 anode signals are collected through custom preamplifiers, digital electronics and acquisition systems. Acquisition and analysis software is also undergoing extensive development. Amplification of the small signals is accomplished using a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). The fill gas, He-CO 2 , provides both particle detection and a homogeneous, variable-thickness target for studying reactions on \u03b1 s, such as 8 Li( \u03b1 ,n) 11 B. A preliminary study of this flagship reaction was carried out in June 2009 and the results are providing feedback into the development of the final detector and infrastructure.

VLong GRBs as a tool to investigate star formation in dark matter halos
p2400
sVabstract
p2401
VFirst stars can only form in structures that are suitably dense, which can be parametrized by the minimum dark matter halo mass M<SUB>min</SUB>. M<SUB>min</SUB> must play an important role in star formation. The connection of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the collapse of massive stars has provided a good opportunity for probing star formation in dark matter halos. We place some constraints on M<SUB>min</SUB> using the latest Swift LGRB data. We conservatively consider that LGRB rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) and an additional evolution parametrized as <SUP>(1 + z) \u03b1</SUP>, where the CSFR model is a function of M<SUB>min</SUB>. Using the \u03c7<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, the contour constraints on the M<SUB>min</SUB>-\u03b1 plane show that at the 1\u03c3 confidence level, we have M<SUB>min</SUB> \u300810<SUP>10.5</SUP>M<SUB>\u2609</SUB> from 118 LGRBs with redshift z \u3008 4 and luminosity L<SUB>iso</SUB> \u3009 1.8 ×10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also find that adding 12 high-z (4 \u3008 z \u3008 5) LGRBs (consisting of 104 LGRBs with z \u3008 5 and L<SUB>iso</SUB> \u3009 3.1 ×10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>) could result in much tighter constraints on M<SUB>min</SUB>, for which, 10<SUP>7.7</SUP>M<SUB>\u2609</SUB> \u3008M<SUB>min</SUB> \u300810<SUP>11.6</SUP>M<SUB>\u2609</SUB> (1\u03c3). Through Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that future five years of Sino-French spacebased multiband astronomical variable objects monitor (SVOM) observations would tighten these constraints to 10<SUP>9.7</SUP>M<SUB>\u2609</SUB> \u3008M<SUB>min</SUB> \u300810<SUP>11.3</SUP>M<SUB>\u2609</SUB>. The strong constraints on M<SUB>min</SUB> indicate that LGRBs are a new promising tool for investigating star formation in dark matter halos.

VVacuum pressure, dark energy and dark matter
p2465
sVabstract
p2466
VIt has been argued that the correct, i.e. positive, sign of quantum vacuum energy density, or more properly, negative sign of quantum vacuum pressure, requires not a very large number, e.g. ~100, of additional, undiscovered fundamental bosonic particle species, absent in the standard model. Interpretation of the new particle species in terms of dark matter ones permits to qualitatively, and even quantitatively, connect all the three concepts given in the title.

VExperimental searches for dark matter
p2502
sVabstract
p2503
VThere is now an enormously rich variety of experimental techniques being brought to bear on experimental searches for dark matter, covering a wide range of suggested forms for it. The existence of ``dark matter'', in some form or other, is inferred from a number of relatively simple observations and the problem has been known for over half a century. To explain ``dark matter'' is one of the foremost challenges today - the answer will be of fundamental importance to cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and general relativists. In this article, I will give a brief review of the observational evidence (concentrating on areas of current significant activity), followed by anequally brief summary of candidate solutions for the `dark matter'. I will then discuss experimental searches, both direct and indirect. Finally, I will offer prospects for the future.

VDark matter detectors
p2530
sVabstract
p2531
VA fundamental question of astrophysics and cosmology is the nature of dark matter. Astrophysical observations show clearly the existence of some kind of dark matter, though they cannot yet reveal its nature. Dark matter can consist of baryonic particles, or of other (known or unknown) elementary particles. Baryonic dark matter probably exists in the form of dust, gas, or small stars. Other elementary particles constituting the dark matter can possibly be measured in terrestrial experiments. Possibilities for dark matter particles are neutrinos, axions, and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). While a direct detection of relic neutrinos seems at the moment impossible, there are experiments looking for baryonic dark matter in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects, and for particle dark matter in the form of axions and WIMPS. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

VDark Matter Detectors as Dark Photon Helioscopes
p2558
sVabstract
p2559
VLight new particles with masses below 10 keV, often considered as a plausible extension of the Standard Model, will be emitted from the solar interior, and can be detected on the Earth with a variety of experimental tools. Here we analyze the new "dark" vector state V, a massive vector boson mixed with the photon via an angle kappa, that in the limit of the small mass m_V has its emission spectrum strongly peaked at low energies. Thus, we utilize the constraints on the atomic ionization rate imposed by the results of the XENON10 experiment to set the limit on the parameters of this model: kappa times m_V< 3 times10^{-12} eV. This makes low-threshold Dark Matter experiments the most sensitive dark vector helioscopes, as our result not only improves current experimental bounds from other searches by several orders of magnitude, but also surpasses even the most stringent astrophysical and cosmological limits in a seven-decade-wide interval of m_V. We generalize this approach to other light exotic particles, and set the most stringent direct constraints on "mini-charged" particles.

In particular, we focus on the possibility of distinguishing the various phases of the SN neutrino emission. The neutrino emission rates from the recent long term Basel/Darmstadt simulations are used to calculate the expected event rates. The recent state-of-the-art SN simulations predict closer fluxes among different neutrino flavors and lower average energies compared to the earlier simulation models. We find that our estimated total event rates are typically a factor of two lower than those predicted using older simulation models. We further find that, with optimistic assumptions on the detector's time resolution (~ 10 ms) and energy threshold (~ 0.1 keV), the neutrinos associated with the accretion phase of the SN can in principle be demarcated out with, for example, a 10-ton Xe detector, although distinguishing the neutrinos associated with the neutronization burst phase of the explosion would typically require several tens of ton detectors. We also comment on the possibility of studying the properties of non-electron flavor neutrinos from the CENNS of SN neutrinos.

VDirection dependence and diurnal modulation in dark matter detectors
p2682
sVabstract
p2683
VIn this paper we study the effect of the channeling of ions recoiling from collisions with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in single crystal detectors. In particular we investigate the possibility that channeling may give rise to diurnal modulations of the counting rate as the Earth rotates relative to the direction of the WIMP wind, and the effect that channeling has on the "quenching factor" of a detector. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

VSecluded WIMP dark matter
p2727
sVabstract
p2728
VWe consider a generic mechanism via which thermal relic WIMP dark matter may be decoupled from the Standard Model, namely through a combination of WIMP annihilation to metastable mediators with subsequent delayed decay to Standard Model states. We illustrate this with explicit examples of WIMPs connected to the Standard Model by metastable bosons or fermions. In all models, provided the WIMP mass is greater than that of the mediator, it can be secluded from the Standard Model with an extremely small elastic scattering cross-section on nuclei and rate for direct collider production. In contrast, indirect signatures from WIMP annihilation are consistent with a weak scale cross-section and provide potentially observable ??-ray signals. We also point out that ??-ray constraints and flavor physics impose severe restrictions on MeV-scale variants of secluded models, and identify limited classes that pass all the observational constraints. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

VExothermic dark matter
p2775
sVabstract
p2776
VWe propose a novel mechanism for dark matter to explain the observed annual modulation signal at DAMA/LIBRA which avoids existing constraints from every other dark matter direct detection experiment including CRESST, CDMS, and XENON10. The dark matter consists of at least two light states with mass ~few GeV and splittings ~5 keV. It is natural for the heavier states to be cosmologically long-lived and to make up an O(1) fraction of the dark matter. Direct detection rates are dominated by the exothermic reactions in which an excited dark matter state down-scatters off of a nucleus, becoming a lower energy state. In contrast to (endothermic) inelastic dark matter, the most sensitive experiments for exothermic dark matter are those with light nuclei and low threshold energies. Interestingly, this model can also naturally account for the observed low-energy events at CoGeNT. The only significant constraint on the model arises from the DAMA/LIBRA unmodulated spectrum but it can be tested in the near future by a low-threshold analysis of CDMS-Si and possibly other experiments including CRESST, COUPP, and XENON100.

p2828
sVabstract
p2829
VIn this Letter we study pair annihilation processes of dark matter (DM) in the Universe, in the case that the DM is an electroweak gauge nonsinglet. In the current Universe, in which the DM is highly nonrelativistic, the nonperturbative effect may enhance the DM annihilation cross sections, especially for that to two photons, by several orders of magnitude. We also discuss sensitivities in future searches for anomalous \u03b3 rays from the galactic center, which originate from DM annihilation.

VI give a review of the development of the concept of dark matter. The dark matter story passed through several stages from a minor observational puzzle to a major challenge for theory of elementary particles. Modern data suggest that dark matter is the dominant matter component in the Universe, and that it consists of some unknown non-baryonic particles. Dark matter is the dominant matter component in the Universe, thus properties of dark matter particles determine the structure of the cosmic web.

VSupersymmetric superheavy dark matter
p2915
sVabstract
p2916
VWe propose the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) as a well-suited candidate for superheavy dark matter (SHDM). Various production mechanisms at the end of inflation can produce SHDM with the correct abundance, $\u005cOmega_{LSP} h^2 \u005csim 0.1$, if its mass is sufficiently high. In particular, gravitational production requires that the mass $m_{LSP}$ of the LSP is above $3\u005ctimes 10^{11} GeV$. Weak interactions remain perturbative despite the large mass hierarchy, $m_{LSP}\u005cgg m_Z$, because of the special decoupling properties of supersymmetry. As a result the model is predictive and we discuss the relevant cosmological processes for the case of a superheavy neutralino within this scheme.

VPerfect Fluid Dark Matter
p2963
sVabstract
p2964
VTaking the flat rotation curve as input and treating the matter content in the galactic halo region as perfect fluid, we obtain space time metric at the galactic halo region in the framework of general relativity. We find that the resultant metric is a non-relativistic-dark-matter-induced space-time embedded in a static Friedmann-Lema^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This means that the flat rotation curve not only leads to the existence of dark matter but also suggests the background geometry of the universe. The flat rotation curve and the demand that the dark matter be non-exotic together indicate a (nearly) flat universe as favored by the modern cosmological observations. We obtain the expressions for energy density and pressure of dark matter halo and consequently the equation of state of dark matter. Various other aspects of the solution are also analyzed.

VSupersymmetric dark matter
p3018
sVabstract
p3019
VThere is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPs in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculations. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.

VA review of the development of the concept of dark matter is given. I begin the review with the description of the discovery of the mass paradox in our Galaxy and in clusters of galaxies. In mid 1970s the amount of observational data was sufficient to suggest the presence of a massive and invisible population around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The nature of the dark population was not clear at that time, but the hypotheses of stellar as well as of gaseous nature of the new population had serious difficulties. These difficulties disappeared when non-baryonic nature of dark matter was suggested in early 1980s. In addition to the presence of Dark Matter, recent observations suggest the presence of Dark Energy, which together with Dark Matter and ordinary baryonic matter makes the total matter/energy density of the Universe equal to the critical cosmological density. There are various hypothesis as for the nature of the dark matter particles, and generally some form of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs) are strongly favored. Both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the greatest challenges for modern physics since their nature is unknown.

VAsymmetric higgsino dark matter
p3108
sVabstract
p3109
VIn the supersymmetric framework, a higgsino asymmetry exists in the universe before the electroweak phase transition. We investigate whether the higgsino is a viable asymmetric dark matter candidate. We find that this is indeed possible. The gauginos, squarks and sleptons must all be very heavy, such that the only electroweak-scale superpartners are the higgsinos. The temperature of the electroweak phase transition must be in the (1-10) GeV range.

VUnparticle dark matter
p3166
sVabstract
p3167
VOnce a parity is introduced in unparticle physics, under which unparticle provided in a hidden conformal sector is odd while all Standard Model particles are even, unparticle can be a suitable candidate for the cold dark matter (CDM) in the present universe through its coupling to the Standard Model Higgs doublet. We find that for Higgs boson mass in the range, 114.4 GeV ??? mh ??? 250 GeV, the relic abundance of unparticle with mass 50 GeV ??? mU ??? 80 GeV can be consistent with the currently observed CDM density. In this scenario, Higgs boson with mass mh ??? 160 GeV dominantly decays into a pair of unparticles and such an invisible Higgs boson may be discovered in future collider experiments. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

VThe evidence for the dark matter of the hot big bang cosmology is about as good as it gets in natural science. The exploration of its nature is now led by direct and indirect detection experiments, to be complemented by advances in the full range of cosmological tests, including judicious consideration of the rich phenomenology of galaxies. The results may confirm ideas about DM already under discussion. If we are lucky we also will be surprised once again.

p3247
sVabstract
p3248
VFor over 50 years astronomers have been taking a careful inventory of matter in the universe. Comparing the visible mass with the amount inferred from dynamical estimators reveals that we do not know the nature of at least 90% of the material in the universe. Even then, the total mass is well below that required to halt the universe from expanding forever. Theoretical arguments compel us to search for dark matter in the form of regular matter as well as non-baryonic pArticles created in the aftermath of the Big Bang. We do know that this material is very dark and that it dominates the internal kinematics, clustering properties and motions of galactic systems. It plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of structure in the universe and it is unlikely that galaxies could have formed without its presence. Determining the nature of dark matter is recognized as one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in modern cosmology; revealing its nature would allow us to construct the history of the universe and also to predict its fate.\u005cn

p3279
sVabstract
p3280
VThe nature and identity of the dark matter of the Universe is one of the most challenging problems facing modern cosmology. Only 5% of the energy density of the Universe can be associated with known forms of matter. Problems for baryonic and neutrino dark matter imply the necessity to search beyond the standard model for dark matter candidates. Emphasis is placed on the prospects for supersymmetric dark matter. ?? 2007 COSPAR.

VSymmetryless dark matter
p3357
sVabstract
p3358
VIt is appealing to stabilize dark matter by the same discrete symmetry that is used to explain the structure of quark and lepton mass matrices. However, to generate the observed fermion mixing patterns, any flavor symmetry must necessarily be broken, rendering dark matter unstable. We study singlet, doublet and triplet SU(2) multiplets of both scalar and fermion dark matter candidates and enumerate the conditions under which no d < 6 dark matter decay operators are generated even in the case if the flavor symmetry is broken to nothing. We show that the VEVs of flavon scalars transforming as higher multiplets (e.g. triplets) of the flavor group must be at the electroweak scale. The most economical way for that is to use SM Higgs boson(s) as flavons. Such models can be tested by the LHC experiments. This scenario requires the existence of additional Froggatt-Nielsen scalars that generate hierarchies in Yukawa couplings. We study the conditions under which large and small flavor breaking parameters can coexist without destabilizing the dark matter.

I review the impact of these observations on some of the main questions relating to dark matter: How much dark matter is there? Where is it located? What is the nature of the dark matter? and what is the amount of baryonic dark matter.

VQuirky composite dark matter
p3473
sVabstract
p3474
VWe propose a new dark matter candidate, quirky dark matter, that is a scalar baryonic bound state of a new non-Abelian force that becomes strong below the electroweak scale. The bound state is made of chiral quirks: new fermions that transform under both the new strong force as well as in a chiral representation of the electroweak group, acquiring mass from the Higgs mechanism. Electric charge neutrality of the lightest baryon requires approximately degenerate quirk masses which also causes the charge radius of the bound state to be negligible. The abundance is determined by an asymmetry that is linked to the baryon and lepton numbers of the universe through electroweak sphalerons. Dark matter elastic scattering with nuclei proceeds through Higgs exchange as well as an electromagnetic polarizability operator which is just now being tested in direct detection experiments. A novel method to search for quirky dark matter is to look for a gamma-ray dark line spectroscopic feature in galaxy clusters that result from the quirky Lyman-alpha or quirky hyperfine transitions. Colliders are expected to dominantly produce quirky mesons, not quirky baryons, consequently large missing energy is not the primary collider signal of the physics associated with quirky dark matter.

p3564
sVabstract
p3565
VKibble mechanism drastically underestimates the production of point-like topological defects, as confirmed recently in atomic and condensed matter systems. If non-thermally produced, they can be cosmological dark matter of mass 1-10 PeV or heavier. If thermalized, skyrmion of mass 1-10 TeV is also a viable dark matter candidate, whose decay may explain e?? spectra in cosmic rays recently measured by PAMELA, FERMI, and H.E.S.S. Collaborations. Models that produce magnetic monopoles below the inflation scale, such as Pati-Salam unification, are ruled out unless new annihilation mechanism for monopoles is introduced. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

VThese lectures are intended to provide a brief pedagogical review of dark matter for the newcomer to the subject. We begin with a discussion of the astrophysical evidence for dark matter. The standard weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) scenario--the motivation, particle models, and detection techniques--is then reviewed. We provide a brief sampling of some recent variations to the standard WIMP scenario as well as some alternatives (axions and sterile neutrinos). Exercises are provided for the reader.

sVabstract
p3688
VMotivated by inflation, the theory of big-bang nucleosynthesis, and the quest for a deeper understanding of fundamental forces and particles, a paradigm for the development of structure in the universe has evolved. It holds that most of the matter exists in the form of slowly moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments\u2014cold dark matter\u2014and that the small density inhomogeneities that seed structure formation arose from quantum fluctuations around 10\u221234 seconds after the big bang. A flood of observations, from determinations of the Hubble constant to measurements of the anisotropy of cosmic background radiation, are now testing the cold dark matter paradigm.

p3733
sVabstract
p3734
VWe explore extensions of inelastic Dark Matter and Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter where the WIMP can scatter to a tower of heavier states. We assume a WIMP mass $m_\u005cchi \u005csim \u005cmathcal{O}(1-100)$ GeV and a constant splitting between successive states $\u005cdelta \u005csim\u005cmathcal{O}(1 - 100)$ keV. For the spin-independent scattering scenario we find that the direct experiments CDMS and XENON strongly constrain most of the DAMA/LIBRA preferred parameter space, while for WIMPs that interact with nuclei via their magnetic moment a region of parameter space corresponding to $m_{\u005cchi}\u005csim 11 $ GeV and $\u005cdelta < 15$ keV is allowed by all the present direct detection constraints.

VI give a review of the development of the concept of dark matter. The dark matter story passed through several stages from a minor observational puzzle to a major challenge for theory of elementary particles. Modern data suggest that dark matter is the dominant matter component in the Universe, and that it consists of some unknown non-baryonic particles. Dark matter is the dominant matter component in the Universe, thus properties of dark matter particles determine the structure of the cosmic web.

VBlack Holes
p3944
sVabstract
p3945
VBlack holes are among the most intriguing objects in modern physics. Their influence ranges from powering quasars and other active galactic nuclei, to providing key insights into quantum gravity. We review the observational evidence for black holes, and briefly discuss some of their properties. We also describe some recent developments involving cosmic censorship and the statistical origin of black hole entropy.

VBlack holes on the brane
p3986
sVabstract
p3987
VWe consider exact solutions for static black holes localized on a three-brane in five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We show that the Reissner-Nordstrom metric is an exact solution of the effective Einstein equations on the brane, re-interpreted as a black hole without electric charge, but with instead a tidal 'charge' arising via gravitational effects from the fifth dimension. The tidal correction to the Schwarzschild potential is negative, which is impossible in general relativity, and in this case only one horizon is admitted, located outside the Schwarzschild horizon. The solution satisfies a closed system of equations on the brane, and describes the strong-gravity regime. Current observations do not strongly constrain the tidal charge, and significant tidal corrections could in principle arise in the strong-gravity regime and for primordial black holes.

p4079
sVabstract
p4080
VWe establish the relation between the structure governing supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric four- and five-dimensional black holes and multicenter solutions and Calabi-Yau flux compactifications of M-theory and type IIB string theory. We find that the known BPS and almost-BPS multicenter black hole solutions can be interpreted as GKP compactifications with (2,1) and (0,3) imaginary self-dual flux. We also show that the most general GKP compactification leads to new classes of BPS and non-BPS multicenter solutions. We explore how these solutions fit into N=2 truncations, and elucidate how supersymmetry becomes camouflaged. As a necessary tool in our exploration we show how the fields in the largest N=2 truncation fit inside the six-torus compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity.

VWe study black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS\u000a                        4 spacetime with scalar hair. Following AdS/CFT dictionary these black holes can be interpreted as thermal states of (2 + 1)-dimensional conformal gauge theory plasma, deformed by a relevant operator. We discover a rich phase structure of the solutions. Surprisingly, we find thermodynamically stable phases with spontaneously broken global symmetries that exist only at high temperatures. These phases are metastable, and join the stable symmetric phase via a mean-field second-order phase transition. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VFragile black holes
p4217
sVabstract
p4218
VThe AdS/CFT correspondence may give a new way of understanding field theories in extreme conditions, as in the quark-gluon plasma phase of quark matter. The correspondence normally involves asymptotically AdS black holes with dual field theories which are defined on locally flat boundary spacetimes; the implicit assumption is that the distortions of spacetime which occur under extreme conditions do not affect the field theory in any unexpected way. However, AdS black holes are [to varying degrees] fragile, in the sense that they become unstable to stringy effects when their event horizons are sufficiently distorted. This implies that field theories on curved backgrounds may likewise be unstable in a suitable sense. We investigate this phenomenon, focussing on the "fragility" of AdS5 black holes with flat event horizons. We find that, when they are distorted, these black holes are always unstable in string theory. This may have consequences for the detailed structure of the quark matter phase diagram at extreme values of the spacetime curvature. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

VGeometrothermodynamics of black holes
p4260
sVabstract
p4261
VThe thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of Weinhold's and Ruppeiner's thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the Reissner-Nordstr\u005ctextbackslash"om black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its phase transition structure.

VDyonic dilaton black holes
p4302
sVabstract
p4303
VThe properties of static spherically symmetric black holes, which are both electrically and magnetically charged, and which are coupled to the dilaton in the presence of a cosmological constant, Lambda, are considered. It is shown that apart from the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter solution with constant dilaton, such solutions do not exist if Lambda > 0 (in arbitrary spacetime dimension >=4 ). However, asymptotically anti-de Sitter dyonic black hole solutions with a non-trivial dilaton do exist if Lambda < 0. Both these solutions and the asymptotically flat (Lambda = 0) solutions are studied numerically for arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling parameter, g_0, in four dimensions. The asymptotically flat solutions are found to exhibit two horizons if g_0 = 0, 1, \u005csqrt{3}, \u005csqrt{6}, ..., \u005csqrt{n(n+1)/2},..., and one horizon otherwise. For asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions the result is similar, but the corresponding values of g_0 are altered in a non-linear fashion which depends on Lambda and the mass and charges of the black holes. All dyonic solutions with Lambda <= 0 are found to have zero Hawking temperature in the extreme limit, however, regardless of the value of g_0.

VLovelock-Lifshitz black holes
p4428
sVabstract
p4429
VIn this paper, we investigate the existence of Lifshitz solutions in Lovelock gravity, both in vacuum and in the presence of a massive vector field. We show that the Lovelock terms can support the Lifshitz solution provided the constants of the theory are suitably chosen. We obtain an exact black hole solution with Lifshitz asymptotics of any scaling parameter $z$ in both Gauss-Bonnet and in pure 3rd order Lovelock gravity. If matter is added in the form of a massive vector field, we also show that Lifshitz solutions in Lovelock gravity exist; these can be regarded as corrections to Einstein gravity coupled to this form of matter. For this form of matter we numerically obtain a broad range of charged black hole solutions with Lifshitz asymptotics, for either sign of the cosmological constant. We find that these asymptotic Lifshitz solutions are more sensitive to corrections induced by Lovelock gravity than are their asymptotic AdS counterparts. We also consider the thermodynamics of the black hole solutions and show that the temperature of large black holes with curved horizons is proportional to $r_0^z$ where $z$ is the critical exponent; this relationship holds for black branes of any size. As is the case for asymptotic AdS black holes, we find that an extreme black hole exists only for the case of horizons with negative curvature. We also find that these Lovelock-Lifshitz black holes have no unstable phase, in contrast to the Lovelock-AdS case. We also present a class of rotating Lovelock-Lifshitz black holes with Ricci-flat horizons.

VBlack holes and beyond
p4476
sVabstract
p4477
VThe black hole information paradox forces us into a strange situation: we must find a way to break the semiclassical approximation in a domain where no quantum gravity effects would normally be expected. Traditional quantizations of gravity do not exhibit any such breakdown, and this forces us into a difficult corner: either we must give up quantum mechanics or we must accept the existence of troublesome 'remnants'. In string theory, however, the fundamental quanta are extended objects, and it turns out that the bound states of such objects acquire a size that grows with the number of quanta in the bound state. The interior of the black hole gets completely altered to a 'fuzzball' structure, and information is able to escape in radiation from the hole. The semiclassical approximation can break at macroscopic scales due to the large entropy of the hole: the measure in the path integral competes with the classical action, instead of giving a subleading correction. Putting this picture of black hole microstates together with ideas about entangled states leads to a natural set of conjectures on many long-standing questions in gravity: the significance of Rindler and de Sitter entropies, the notion of black hole complementarity, and the fate of an observer falling into a black hole. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

VIntermediate-mass Black Holes
p4516
sVabstract
p4517
VThe mathematical simplicity of black holes, combined with their links to some of the most energetic events in the universe, means that black holes are key objects for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Until recently, it was generally believed that black holes in nature appear in two broad mass ranges: stellar-mass (M~3\u201320 M\u2299), which are produced by the core collapse of massive stars, and supermassive (M~106\u20131010 M\u2299), which are found in the centers of galaxies and are produced by a still uncertain combination of processes. In the last few years, however, evidence has accumulated for an intermediate-mass class of black holes, with M~102\u2013104 M\u2299. If such objects exist they have important implications for the dynamics of stellar clusters, the formation of supermassive black holes, and the production and detection of gravitational waves. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes and discuss future observational and theoretical work that will help clarify numerous outstanding questions about t...

VRicci nilsoliton black holes
p4571
sVabstract
p4572
VWe follow a constructive approach and find higher-dimensional black holes with Ricci nilsoliton horizons. The spacetimes are solutions to the Einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant and generalise therefore, Anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. The approach combines a work by Lauret-which relates the so-called Ricci nilsolitons and Einstein solvmanifolds-and an earlier work by the author. The resulting black hole spacetimes are asymptotically Einstein solvmanifolds and thus, are examples of solutions which are not asymptotically Anti-de Sitter. We show that any nilpotent group in dimension n \u2264 6 has a corresponding Ricci nilsoliton black hole solution in dimension (n + 2). Furthermore, we show that in dimensions (n + 2) > 8, there exist an infinite number of locally distinct Ricci nilsoliton black hole metrics. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VBlack holes without firewalls
p4616
sVabstract
p4617
VThe postulates of black hole complementarity do not imply a firewall for infalling observers at a black hole horizon. The dynamics of the stretched horizon, that scrambles and re-emits information, determines whether infalling observers experience anything out of the ordinary when entering a large black hole. In particular, there is no firewall if the stretched horizon degrees of freedom retain information for a time of order the black hole scrambling time.

VBubbling AdS Black Holes
p4664
sVabstract
p4665
VWe explore the non-BPS analog of `AdS bubbles', which are regular spherically symmetric 1/2 BPS geometries in type IIB supergravity. They have regular horizons and can be thought of as bubbling generalizations of non-extremal AdS black hole solutions in five-dimensional gauged supergravity. Due to the appearance of the Heun equation even at the linearized level, various approximation and numerical methods are needed in order to extract information about this system. We study how the vacuum expectation value and mass of a particular dimension two chiral primary operator depend on the temperature and chemical potential of the thermal Yang-Mills theory. In addition, the mass of the bubbling AdS black holes is computed. As is shown numerically, there are also non-BPS solitonic bubbles which are completely regular and arise from continuous deformations of BPS AdS bubbles.

VEvanescent black holes
p4717
sVabstract
p4718
VA renormalizable theory of quantum gravity coupled to a dilaton and conformal matter in two spacetime dimensions is analyzed. The theory is shown to be exactly solvable classically. Included among the exact classical solutions are configurations describing the formation of a black hole by collapsing matter. The problem of Hawking radiation and back reaction of the metric is analyzed to leading order in a 1N expansion, where N is the number of matter fields. The results suggest that the collapsing matter radiates away all of its energy before an event horizon has a chance to form, and black holes thereby disappear from the quantum-mechanical spectrum. It is argued that the matter asymptotically approaches a zero-energy "bound state" which can carry global quantum numbers and that a unitary S matrix including such states should exist.

VBohr-like black holes
p4772
sVabstract
p4773
VThe idea that black holes (BHs) result in highly excited states representing both the "hydrogen atom" and the "quasi-thermal emission" in quantum gravity is today an intuitive but general conviction. In this paper it will be shown that such an intuitive picture is more than a picture. In fact, we will discuss a model of quantum BH somewhat similar to the historical semi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in 1913. The model is completely consistent with existing results in the literature, starting from the celebrated result of Bekenstein on the area quantization.

VLinear dilaton black holes
p4817
sVabstract
p4818
VWe present new solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity in four dimensions describing black holes which asymptote to the linear dilaton background. In the non-rotating case they can be obtained as the limiting geometry of dilaton black holes. The rotating solutions (possibly endowed with a NUT parameter) are constructed using a generating technique based on the Sp(4,R) duality of the EMDA system. In a certain limit (with no event horizon present) our rotating solutions coincide with supersymmetric Israel-Wilson-Perjes type dilaton-axion solutions. In presence of an event horizon supersymmetry is broken. The temperature of the static black holes is constant, and their mass does not depend on it, so the heat capacity is zero. We investigate geodesics and wave propagation in these spacetimes and find superradiance in the rotating case. Because of the non-asymptotically flat nature of the geometry, certain modes are reflected from infinity, in particular, all superradiant modes are confined. This leads to classical instability of the rotating solutions. The non-rotating linear dilaton black holes are shown to be stable under spherical perturbations.

VBranes wrapping black holes
p4865
sVabstract
p4866
VWe examine the dynamics of extended branes, carrying lower-dimensional brane charges, wrapping black holes and black hole microstates in M and type II string theory. We show that they have a universal dispersion relation typical of threshold bound states with a total energy equal to the sum of the contributions from the charges. In near-horizon geometries of black holes, these are BPS states, and the dispersion relation follows from supersymmetry as well as properties of the conformal algebra. However they break all supersymmetries of the full asymptotic geometries of black holes and microstates. We comment on a recent proposal which uses these states to explain black hole entropy. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VPrimordial black holes
p4928
sVabstract
p4929
VPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are a profound signature of primordial cosmological structures and\u005cnprovide a theoretical tool to study nontrivial physics of the early Universe. The mechanisms of PBH\u005cnformation are discussed and observational constraints on the PBH spectrum, or effects of PBH\u005cnevaporation, are shown to restrict a wide range of particle physics models, predicting an\u005cnenhancement of the ultraviolet part of the spectrum of density perturbations, early dust-like\u005cnstages, first order phase transitions and stages of superheavy metastable particle dominance in the\u005cnearly Universe. The mechanism of closed wall contraction can lead, in the inflationary Universe, to\u005cna new approach to galaxy formation, involving primordial clouds of massive BHs created around the\u005cnintermediate mass or supermassive BH and playing the role of galactic seeds.

VMap art
p5018
sVabstract
p5019
VArtists make maps. Inspired by maps made by the Surrealists, by the Situationists, by Pop Artists, and especially by Conceptualists of every stripe, artists in increasing numbers have taken up the map as an expressive medium. In an age less and less enamored of traditional forms of representation \u2013 and increasingly critical \u2013 maps have numerous attractions for artists. Beyond their formal continuities, maps and paintings are both communicative, that is, constructs intended to affect behavior. As the energy of painting has been dispersed over the past half century into earth art, conceptual art, installation art, performance art, video art, cyber art, and so on, it has dispersed the map as a subject along with it. The irresistible tug maps exert on artists arises from the map\u2019s mask of neutral objectivity, from its mask of unauthored dispassion. Artists either strip this mask off the map, or fail to put one on. In either case artists simultaneously point to the mask worn by the map, while they enter unmasked into the very discourse of the map. In so doing map artists are erasing the line cartographers have tried to draw between their form of graphic communication (maps) and others (drawings, paintings, and so on). In this way map artists are reclaiming the map as a discourse function for people in general. The flourishing of map art signals the imminent demise of the map as a privileged form of communication. The map is dead! Long live the map!

VPerspective map
p5061
sVabstract
p5062
VA wearable computer is a potential platform for map applications: it is mobile in nature, and is often equipped with a head-worn display capable of displaying maps of the surrounding area in graphical form. In this paper, we present a map application, called WalkMap, developed for wearable computers. We concentrate on the visual presentation of the map, and propose a visualization method that is based on perspective distortion of a regular two-dimensional birds-eye view map. We also describe the results of a field study, and compare the distorted view to a regular two-dimensional view. The results show that while a perspective Visualization is feasible for some navigational tasks, for some other tasks a regular map is preferred.

VDistribution Map
p5140
sVabstract
p5141
VUnderstanding large software systems is a challenging task, and to support it many approaches have been developed. Often, the result of these approaches categorize existing entities into new groups or associates them with mutually exclusive properties. In this paper we present the distribution map as a generic technique to visualize and analyze this type of result. Our technique is based on the notion of focus, which shows whether a property is well-encapsulated or cross-cutting, and the notion of spread, which shows whether the property is present in several parts of the system. We present a basic visualization and complement it with measurements that quantify focus and spread. To validate our technique we show evidence of applying it on the result sets of different analysis approaches. As a conclusion we propose that the distribution map technique should belong to any reverse engineering toolkit

VMap Semantics
p5192
sVabstract
p5193
VCould there be a semantics of maps--a theory which would stand in the same relation to maps as (ordinary) semantics stands in to (ordinary) languages? And what would such a theory look like? This paper addresses these questions from the standpoint of the doctrine that a semantics for a language is a theory which gives the truth-conditions for expressions in that language. We show how a semantics for certain simple sorts of maps can be constructed by analogy with minimal modal semantics for the predicate calculus under default reasoning. We go on to show, however, that other sorts of maps Challenge a fundamental as- sumption about truth-conditional approaches to semantics. In particular, we see how the figure/ground ambiguity inherent in some maps forces us to re-think the role played by the syntactical organisation underlying an account of truth-conditions.

VMap theory
p5228
sVabstract
p5229
VMap theory is a foundation of mathematics based on ??-calculus instead of logic and sets, and thereby fulfills Church's original aim of introducing ??-calculus. Map theory can do anything set theory can do. In particular, all of classical mathematics is contained in may theory. In addition, and contrary to set theory, map theory has unlimited abstraction and contains a computer programming language as a natural subset. This makes map theory more suited to deal with mechanical procedures than set theory. In addition, the unlimited abstraction allows definition, e.g., of the notion of truth and the category of all categories. This paper introduces map theory, gives a number of applications and gives a relative consistency proof. To demonstrate the expressive power of map theory, the paper develops ZFC set theory within map theory. ?? 1992.

VCognitive map
p5264
sVabstract
p5265
VA cognitive map (also: mental map or mental model) is a type of mental representation which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. The concept was introduced by Edward Tolman in 1948.\u005cnCognitive maps have been studied in various fields, such as psychology, education, archaeology, planning, geography, cartography, architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, management and history. As a consequence, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive maps, mental maps, scripts, schemata, and frames of reference.\u005cnCognitive maps serve the construction and accumulation of spatial knowledge, allowing the "mind's eye" to visualize images in order to reduce cognitive load, enhance recall and learning of information. This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving memory and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.\u005cnThe neural correlates of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the place cell system in the hippocampus and the recently discovered grid cells in the entorhinal cortex.

VAdult students often struggle to appreciate the relevance of their higher educational experiences to their careers. Capella University's competency map is a dashboard that visually indicates each student's status relative to specific assessed competencies. MBA students who utilize their competency map demonstrate competencies at slightly higher levels and persist in their program at greater rates, even after statistically controlling for powerful covariates, such as course engagement.

VMap torchlight
p5353
sVabstract
p5354
VThe advantages of paper-based maps have been utilized in the field of mobile Augmented Reality (AR) in the last few years. Traditional paper-based maps provide high-resolution, large-scale information with zero power consumption. There are numerous implementations of magic lens interfaces that combine high-resolution paper maps with dynamic handheld displays. From an HCI perspective, the main challenge of magic lens interfaces is that users have to switch their attention between the magic lens and the information in the background. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by using a lightweight mobile camera projector unit to augment the paper map directly with additional information. The "Map Torchlight" is tracked over a paper map and can precisely highlight points of interest, streets, and areas to give directions or other guidance for interacting with the map.

VRaytheon Six Sigma is a proprietary six-step process that Raytheon Co, a defense and aerospace systems supplier, has embedded into its culture. It was developed by an internal team that was guided by the company's top leadership. The team created the process by leveraging the company's best practices, benchmarking other companies' Six Sigma programs and using the assistance of external experts. Raytheon calls this initiative Catalyst Engagement. Every Catalyst Engagement is supported by a Raytheon Six Sigma Black Belt (BB) or Master Black Belt (MBB). The project is led by a manager who participated in a workshop led by a BB or MBB. These managers are chosen through a disciplined process that Raytheon is helping to pioneer called social network analysis (SNA). The Catalyst Engagement process consists of six distinct steps: 1. Select projects. 2. Conduct the SNA study. 3. Identify workshop participants. 4. Conduct leadership workshops and identify catalyst fellows. 5. Conduct Catalyst Engagement projects. 6. Complete the process.

VModern \u201cwarehouse scale computers\u201d (WSCs) continue to be embraced as homogeneous computing platforms. However, due to frequent machine replacements and upgrades, modern WSCs are in fact composed of diverse commodity microarchitectures and machine configurations. Yet, current WSCs are architected with the assumption of homogeneity, leaving a potentially significant performance opportunity unexplored. In this paper, we expose and quantify the performance impact of the\u201chomogeneity assumption\u201dfor modern production WSCs using industry-strength large-scale web-service workloads. In addition, we argue for, and evaluate the benefits of, a heterogeneity-aware WSC using commercial web-service production workloads including Google\u2019s websearch. We also identify key factors impacting the available performance opportunity when exploiting heterogeneity and introduce a new metric, opportunity factor, to quantify an application\u2019s sensitivity to the heterogeneity in a given WSC. To exploit heterogeneity in \u201chomogeneous\u201d WSCs, we propose \u201cWhare-Map,\u201d the WSC Heterogeneity Aware Mapper that leverages already in-place continuous profiling subsystems found in production environments. When employing \u201cWhare-Map\u201d, we observe a cluster-wide performance improvement of 15% on average over heterogeneity\u2013 oblivious job placement and up to an 80% improvement for web-service applications that are particularly sensitive to heterogeneity.

VMap mania:
p5574
sVabstract
p5575
VThe rival claims over Macedonia by the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Turks prompted the so-called \u2018map mania\u2019 in the 1870s as national antagonisms were played out in conflicting cartographic representations of the southern Balkans. With the establishment of Greece in the early 1830s the majority of the Greek population had been left in Ottoman lands beyond the sovereign state's frontiers. This gave rise to a militant irredentist ideology, known as the \u2018Great Idea\u2019, which pressed for the aggrandisement of the fledgling state to encompass all the Eastern lands inhabited by Greeks in a reconstituted Byzantine Empire. The present paper begins with a discussion of the meanings that accumulated around the concept of the \u2018frontier\u2019 in Greek nationalist thought and focuses on the debates in Greece about the imperative to redefine the Greek Kingdom's boundaries in the Balkans and Asia Minor. An analysis of these debates sheds light on a wider process: the naturalisation of boundaries in late 19th century Europe. In the course of the paper an examination is made of the ways in which geographical discourse served to legitimate claims to, and consolidate, territories. The emphasis on an imperialist geography co-existed with a celebration of local, regional geographies, and a key word of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Greek nationalist discourse was \u2018place\u2019 (topos). The argument is put that the particularities of \u2018place\u2019 were construed both as underpinning a territorial expansion and as a resistance to the homogenising drive of a state sponsored nationalism.

VMap interaction represents an important development in the functionality and power of geographic representations. The addition of interactivity has the potential to circumvent many of the frustrating limitations of cartography, primarily the necessarily limited perspective of the cartographer. Static maps are the result of a long series of subjective choices of the cartographer, but with the addition of interactivity, many of those choices are offloaded onto the map user, who can customize the map in order to better suit his or her needs. Cartographers, whose role has traditionally been the optimal representation of geographic data, now face an additional role of providing the means for responsible and advantageous interaction. This article summarizes the many different ways that interaction on maps can facilitate geographic understanding and increase the functionality of maps. It presents a systematic approach to thinking about interaction that can inform future designs, reviews existing approaches to interacting with modern computer maps (e.g., GIS and Google Earth), and speculates about technological advances of the future that may require a significant rethinking of the nature and uses of interaction in cartography.

VArchaeoSTOR map
p5661
sVabstract
p5662
VModern field science, including archaeology, utilizes a massive amount of digital data captured by state-of-the-art measurement instruments. Large archaeological data sets may include images, geospatial data, analytical data, and metadata. Geospatial information plays a central role in the life cycle of those data; information is collected, organized, and published for analyses and visualization as final output using geospatial data as an index. The web is an ideal place to publish scientific data and promote diverse collaboration, and thus we need a system to publish digital archaeological data efficiently so that it is also integrated in our data management workflow. In order to realize this goal, we designed and implemented a web-based application named ArcheoSTOR Map, which visualizes and publishes raw archaeological data onto a map. © 2012 Authors.

VSomatosensory Map
p5760
sVabstract
p5761
VIn the mouse trigeminal pathway, sensory inputs from distinct facial structures, such as whiskers or lower jaw and lip, are topographically mapped onto the somatosensory cortex through relay stations in the thalamus and hindbrain. In the developing hindbrain, the mechanisms generating such maps remain elusive. We found that in the principal sensory nucleus, the whisker-related map is contributed by rhombomere 3-derived neurons, whereas the rhombomere 2-derived progeny supply the lower jaw and lip representation. Moreover, early Hoxa2 expression in neuroepithelium prevents the trigeminal nerve from ectopically projecting to the cerebellum, whereas late expression in the principal sensory nucleus promotes selective arborization of whisker-related afferents and topographic connectivity to the thalamus. Hoxa2 inactivation further results in the absence of whisker-related maps in the postnatal brain. Thus, Hoxa2- and rhombomere 3-dependent cues determine the whisker area map and are required for the assembly of the whisker-to-barrel somatosensory circuit.

p5826
sVabstract
p5827
VOn the Internet, users often encounter noise in the form of spelling errors or unknown words, however, dishonest, unreliable, or biased information also acts as noise that makes it difficult to find credible sources of information. As people come to rely on the Internet for more and more information, reducing this credibility noise grows ever more urgent. The STATEMENT MAP project's goal is to help Internet users evaluate the credibility of information sources by mining the Web for a variety of viewpoints on their topics of interest and presenting them to users together with supporting evidence in a way that makes it clear how they are related. In this paper, we show how a STATEMENT MAP system can be constructed by combining Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, focusing on the task of organizing statements retrieved from the Web by viewpoints. We frame this as a semantic relation classification task, and identify 4 semantic relations: [AGREEMENT], [CONFLICT], [CONFINEMENT], and [EVIDENCE]. The former two relations are identified by measuring semantic similarity through sentence alignment, while the latter two are identified through sentence-internal discourse processing. As a prelude to end-to-end user evaluation of STATEMENT MAP, we present a large-scale evaluation of semantic relation classification between user queries and Internet texts in Japanese and conduct detailed error analysis to identify the remaining areas of improvement.

VThis article reports on a preliminary study, which investigates if vibration and speech feedback can be used in order to make a digital map on a touch screen device more accessible. We test if vibration feedback combined with speech, triggered as the finger moves over relevant map objects, works to make sense of the map content. The study results indicate that it is indeed possible to get a basic overview of the map layout even if a person does not have access to the visual presentation. In the conclusions the interaction problems are indentified and suggestions for future improvements are given.

VThe objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.

VMAP kinases
p6362
sVabstract
p6363
VThe mammalian family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is activated by diverse extracellular and intracellular stimuli, and thereby they play an essential role in connecting cell-surface receptors to changes in transcriptional programs. The MAPK signaling pathways regulate a wide range of cellular activities and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review summarizes recent findings on the regulatory mechanism of MAPK signaling pathways, focusing on nuclear targets and their role in IBD. Finally, it summarizes how these signaling pathways have been exploited for the development of therapeutics and discuss the current knowledge of potential MAPK inhibitors and their anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials related to IBD.
